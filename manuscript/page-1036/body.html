He struck into one of the sheep paths, and, crossing the clearing with rapid steps, they came suddenly upon a horse, caparisoned for a rider of no mean rank. The noble beast snorted and pawed the earth, as his master approached and replaced the pistols in the holsters.</p><p>Harper then turned, and, taking the hand of Frances, spoke as follows:--</p><p>"You have this night saved your brother, Miss Wharton.
