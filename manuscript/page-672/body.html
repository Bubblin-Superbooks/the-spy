I have often charged upon the bayonets of infantry, over greater difficulties than this."</p><p>"You will please to remember, Captain John Lawton, that I am not the riding master of the regiment--nor a drill sergeant--nor a crazy cornet; no, sir--and I speak it with a due respect for the commission of the Continental Congress--nor an inconsiderate captain, who regards his own life as little as that of his enemies. I am only, sir, a poor humble man of letters, a mere doctor of medicine, an unworthy graduate of Edinburgh, and a surgeon of dragoons; nothing more, I do assure you, Captain John Lawton." So saying, he turned his horse's head towards the cottage, and recommenced his ride.</p></div> </div>
